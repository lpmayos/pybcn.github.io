I&amp;rsquo;m Pavel, but, please, call me just Pasha. I relocated just 2 years ago to Barcelona. I&amp;rsquo;m using python already for 10 years and really love the flexibility of this language. But if you&amp;rsquo;ll ask me what are my most loved programming languages, Python won&amp;rsquo;t be in my top 2. I can explain you why so after several beers in the bar. Now I&amp;rsquo;m working as a Team Leader, but I never stop writing code and practicing Python.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://pybcn.org/people/pavel-sulimov/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pybcn.org/people/pavel-sulimov/</guid><description>PhD in Computer Science.
